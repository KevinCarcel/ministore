## Features

On this site, you have the possibility to register, log in, log out and delete your account.

You can also view the **Ministore** shop with the possibility of making a cart, which will lead, if you validate, to an order for which you can choose the delivery address.

This delivery address can either be your home address provided or modified at registration, or a global relay that you can select directly on the site.

You then have the possibility to see the summary of your order but also to see your order history on your profile.

For administrative features, they will be explained to you on the administrator dashboard which you can access via the 'man in tie' icon on the main page.
